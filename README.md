# quote-generator
This is a random quote generator(Mobile Friendly) that uses my own heroku-app proxy-server. By doing this, the proxy-server can handle any number of requests from the application where it is being used.

Since it is a personal proxy server, it won't work out for the with that much ease for y'all. (It will give a 429 error since limited requests would be allowed)
